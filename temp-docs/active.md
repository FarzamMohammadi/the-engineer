# Active Work

## Current Focus

Architecture and planning ONLY. No code. No project scaffolding. No implementation.

All deliverables are documentation until Farzam explicitly says otherwise.

## What We're Doing

Designing The Engineer from the highest level down — making every architectural decision, resolving every uncertainty, and documenting everything before writing a single line of code.

Working method: collaborative, always. Highest level decisions first, then drill down together. Research, investigate, and discuss until confident. Farzam and the agent complete each other.

## Deliverables

All work lives in `/temp-docs/`:
- `active.md` — this file, what we're working on right now
- `goals.md` — the destination; what The Engineer achieves
- `philosophy.md` — project beliefs and principles (permanent, say it once)
- `sessions/` — succinct logs of each work session
- `architecture/` — all architectural work (see [`architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md) for full index)
  - `layers.md` — architecture layering roadmap
  - `decisions.md` — decision log
  - `overview.md` — high-level components + skeleton/plugin classification
  - `task-states.md` — CPU-derived task state machine

## Repo Structure

```

├── README.md          # Project overview
├── persona.md         # Identity (stable input to architecture)
└── temp-docs/         # Our workspace (builders only)
    ├── active.md      # Current focus (this file)
    ├── goals.md       # The destination (14 sections)
    ├── philosophy.md  # Core beliefs (11 principles)
    ├── sessions/      # Session logs
    └── architecture/  # All architectural work (see README.md inside)
```

Everything else in the repo will be for The Engineer (the agent) — created AFTER architecture is finalized.

## Status

Session 3 complete. Defined the 6-layer architecture roadmap (`layers.md`). Added skeleton vs plugin classification to all components in `overview.md`. Cross-referenced all docs where needed — every doc now links to its related context.

Currently at **Layer 1: System Overview** with 3 items remaining:
- [ ] Component relationships — what calls what, what depends on what
- [ ] Data flow — what "things" move through the system
- [x] Skeleton vs plugin classification — done (in `overview.md`)
- [x] High-level state machine — done (`task-states.md`)

Next session: tackle the remaining Layer 1 items — **component relationships** and **data flow**. Then Layer 1 is complete and we move to Layer 2.
