# Future Considerations

Decisions that are intentionally deferred — not because they're uncertain, but because the v1 design explicitly doesn't need them yet. Each item describes when it becomes relevant and what the migration path looks like.

## Monorepo Evolution

**Current state (v1):** Single package. `src/core/`, `src/adapters/`, `src/plugins/`, `src/schemas/` are directory boundaries, not package boundaries.

**When it becomes relevant:** When third-party plugins need a separate, publishable SDK package they can `import` from — just the adapter interfaces, shared types, and event schemas. Not the entire Core internals.

**What a monorepo enables:**

```
packages/
  core/                  # The brain — depends on plugin-sdk
    src/
      task-engine/
      orchestrator/
      daemon/
      ...
  plugin-sdk/            # Publishable package — curated exports for plugin authors
    src/
      index.ts           # Re-exports adapter interfaces + shared schemas + event types
  plugins/               # Each plugin depends only on plugin-sdk
    github-trigger/
    telegram-comm/
    ...
```

**Migration path:** The v1 source layout is designed so that this extraction is a move-and-rename, not a restructure:
- `src/adapters/index.ts` already acts as the plugin-sdk re-export boundary → becomes `packages/plugin-sdk/src/index.ts`
- `src/schemas/` contains all shared types → moves to `packages/plugin-sdk/src/schemas/`
- `src/core/` → `packages/core/src/`
- `src/plugins/` → individual packages or `packages/plugins/` workspace

**Tools needed:** pnpm workspaces (already chosen, Decision #67), separate tsconfig per package (tsconfig references), potentially separate Vitest configs per package.

**Pattern reference:** OpenClaw uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk` as a curated re-export package for plugin authors. See [`4-implementation/openclaw-review.md`](4-implementation/openclaw-review.md) § Plugin SDK as curated re-export.
